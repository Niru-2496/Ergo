### Project Description
It is a calender cum to-do list website with Auto prioritizing mode to complete deadlines 

### The Problem statement
Many individuals struggle to manage their time effectively, leading to missed deadlines, increased stress, and decreased productivity. Traditional calendars and to-do lists often require manual prioritization, which can be time-consuming and may not always reflect the urgency or importance of tasks.

### The Solution
So we're here to solve this using an auto prioritizing mode. We can complete our deadlines without having to worry about missing it! We will keep you motivated with motivational pop ups. So have fun using ERGO!!!
