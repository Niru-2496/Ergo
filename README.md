### Project Description
[It is a calender cum to-do list website with Auto prioritizing mode to complete deadlines ]

### The Problem statement
[Many individuals struggle to manage their time effectively, leading to missed deadlines, increased stress, and decreased productivity. Traditional calendars and to-do lists often require manual prioritization, which can be time-consuming and may not always reflect the urgency or importance of tasks.]
